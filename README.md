Abstract

A postsecondary education is one of the most important tools a young adult can have when starting their career, especially in the United States. 
In order to pay for such an education, prospective students often need to take out student loans which need to be paid back and an inability to pay these loans back can be detrimental to the future of graduates. 
To this end, one of this most important choices a student faces when entering postsecondary education is what to study and where. 
This research investigates which of those factors is more likely to predict an ability to pay back the student loans taken out. 
The College Scorecard dataset, compiled by the U.S. Department of Education, is used as the backbone of the research and provides a wealth of data to be considered.

The findings from this research show that the quality of the institution, determined by graduation rate and cost of attendance, hold much more predictive qualities than any specific area of study a student chooses. 
Additional research shows that there are other factors that are even stronger predictors of whether a student can repay their student loans and include family income of the student and earnings after graduation as both are statistically significant predictors. 
In general it is found that it is difficult to find factors fully within control of the prospective student that can consistently predict the ability to repay student loans and therefore more research is needed to 
create compound factors to be able to educate students on what they should study and where they should study in order to give themselves the best chance to repay any student loans needed.
